## Minutia 11
### Maia Ezratty

### The History of Databases
* Flat Tile Databases
* The indices method was a really big deal since it saved a lot of time and storage (which used to be very expensive)
* Yet this method was still monolithic, so...
* The method of linking tables together was the next big idea, and it led to Relational databases which were better for storage
* You make a Relational Database using SQL (Structured Querry Language)
* Examples: Oracle, Sybase, IBM, DB2, Dbase, paradox
* Mysql brought SQL to the masses, except that it was still inconvenient because of the amount of administrative work
* postgresql --> idea of transaction
* sqlite3 is what we will use, and there is no administration!

### Building a Database
* Students with an ID, Lastname, Firstname (i.e., 1000, Parker, Peter)

### Superheros
* Spiderman -- bitten by a radioactive spider
* Batman -- bitten by a radioactive bat
* Superman -- bitten by a radioactive super
* Iron man -- bitten by a radioactive iron
* Catwoman -- ...what's a catwo??
* Hunter Herman is the only superhero in our class, bitten by a radioactive 'her'
