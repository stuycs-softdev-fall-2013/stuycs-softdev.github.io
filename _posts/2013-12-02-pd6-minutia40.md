## Minutia 40 Period 6
### 12/2/2013
### Arfan Rehab

### Fried Turkey
We started off class by talking about how delicious fried turkey is and the fact that frying any food with cheese and 
bacon makes it good. Mr. Zamansky then gave us a short physics lesson explaining it.

### Functions in Javascript
Functions in js are what makes it cool. Mr. Zamansky showed us that we can write a factorial function just like in java.
These are some unfamiliar ways of writing and using the function on the console itself.
```
(function(a,b) { return a+b; }) (4,4) --> return 8
```
We can also assign a function to a variable.
```
var f = function(a,b) {
	return a + b;
}
```
This function simply takes all the words inside the list tags and colors them red. We can also make them stripes by making the even numbers blue and the odd ones red.
```
var stripe = function() {
	var items = document.querySelectorAll("li");
	for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
		items[i].classList.add('red');
	}
}
```
This function simply manipulates anything the font size within the html file and can be seen live.
```
var grow = function(q,size) {
	var items = document.querySelectorAll(q);
	for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
		var size = parseInt(items[i].style.fontSize)
		size = size + 10;
		items[i].style.fontSize = size + "px";
	}
}
```

### Equal signs in javascript
= sign is simply an assignment. 
== sign compares two variable but doesn't take in to account their types, so a string and an int can be equal.
=== is stronger and checks for the variable types.
