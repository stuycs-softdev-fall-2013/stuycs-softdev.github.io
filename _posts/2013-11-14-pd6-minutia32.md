# Minutia 32 Period 6
## Steve Zhu
### 11/14/13

Project work in teams today. We discussed and planned out any ideas we had and distributed roles.

__Other news__  
It seems like a git workflows lesson is coming up.  
My prediction is merge and branch workflows. Let's see if I'm right. (^ _ ^)

__More stuff__  
git push -f is not for mere mortals to use.
