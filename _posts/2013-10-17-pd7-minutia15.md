###MongoDB

* MongoDB is a database run in javascript designed around the concept of monolithic data, which, in contrast to the many varieties of sql, is intended to be used with totally independant "tables" or "collections"
* To use MongoDB in python you can install and import MongoPY, which is functionally the same as the javascript version
* The primary benefit of using MongoDB (in our case) is that it is directly integrated with the language. This means that the data returned is immediately usable in code, and represents familiar structs (dictionaries, lists). 
* MongoDB is also a schemaless database. This means that any entry can have a variable number of named fields. While this limits the hardened structure of schema-based databases, it allows for more flexible datasets.
