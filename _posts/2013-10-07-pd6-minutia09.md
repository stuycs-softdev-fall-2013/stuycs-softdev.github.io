##### The Problem with Shelves
`Python`'s `shelves` clearly aren't sufficiently robust to handle the large
amounts of persistent data that most web applications require; a better tool
would be a dedicated database (think `SQL`). 

Today, the class was split into groups of four, and asked to brainstorm solutions
to the following problem: 

<code>How would you design a framework that would hold students'
information, including their:
+ names
+ ages
+ and transcripts  

... (amongst other things)?</code>

After some time, one representative from each cluster circulated around the classroom,
explaining his/her group's approach to others. Most students chose to nest `arrays` within `arrays`,
and create `classes` for the large chunks of information that would be common to a group
of students (think a class roster, which would be identical for the ~thirty students 
within said class) to minimize data redundancy.
