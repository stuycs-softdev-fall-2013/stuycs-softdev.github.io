###Notice:

Mr. Z made it clear that it was uncool for people to mess around with the google spreadsheet because people were still trying to organize into groups.

###Geolocation Stuff:

The basic function to get one's current position:
	navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition();


Parsing Latitude and Longitude Coordinates and sending it through to Google Maps:

	function showPosition(position)
	{
	    var elt = document.createElement("p");
	    elt.innerHTML="Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + 
	        "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude; 
	    x.appendChild(elt);
	    initialize(position)
	}


	var map;
	function initialize(p) {
	    console.log(p);
	  var mapOptions = {
	    zoom: 11,
	    center: new google.maps.LatLng(p.coords.latitude,p.coords.longitude)
	  };
	  map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'),
	      mapOptions);
	    var ll = new google.maps.LatLng(p.coords.latitude,p.coords.longitude)
	    var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
	        position:ll,
	        map:map,
	        title:'Me'})

	}

The coordinates that appear are based off of the infrastructure of the network as opposed to the GPS on a phone. The google map that was shown in class mapped a relatively accurate map that pinpointed Stuyvesant. Last year, google maps found city hall instead.

###Looking ahead:

We will go into this stuff into greater detail after the break.
