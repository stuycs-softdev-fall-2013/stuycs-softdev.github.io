<h1>Minutia 36 Period 7</h1>

<h2>Jeremy Karson</h2>

<h2>11-26-13</h2>

<h2>Guest Speaker</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today, guest speaker <strong>Sam Gerstenzang</strong> came to to our class.</li>
<li>Education: Stuy '09, Stanford '13 (History major, Symbolic Systems minor)</li>
<li>He says he has worked at many startups throughout his career.</li>
<li>He currently works as a venture capitalist at Andreesen Horowitz ("A-16-Z"). The job of his team is to INVEST IN STARTUPS!</li>
<li>His job entails sitting in his office and meeting with many potential targets of investment about their ideas. He helps to determine which companies A-16-Z will invest in.</li>
<li>His ultimate aspiration is to start his own company. He thinks that the knowledge of startups that he gains at A-16-H will be extremely useful to him.</li>
<li>He described his work at A-16-Z as "extremely intellectually stimulating", giving him the opportunity to learn a new industry every day.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Startup: business, ready (or attempting) to massively scale, that is in a state of betting its entire existence. (*Note: Facebook is no longer a startup!)</li>
<li>Venture Capital: find and invest in startups, and then help them grow in to big companies. (*Note: Not to be confused with ADventure capital).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>A-16-Z is actually funded by investors. In other words, investors are investing in investors. We call this: investorception.</li>
<li>Investment Math: If a company is valued at $10 million, and A-16-H invests $5 million, A-16-H owns a third of the company (and a third of the potential gain in value of the company)</li>
<li>A-16-Z sees 300 companies a year, and ultimately invests in 12-15.</li>
<li>Gertsenzang says he is willing to endure flops as long as he also gets "unicorns" -- companies that are ultiamtely worth $1 billion. He described how it is inevitable and acceptable for a wide degree of the company's profits to come from a few major successes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Criteria for Getting an Investment</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Is this a big idea?" - Does this create a lot of value for a user? Does it make it 10x better for the user? How big is the market? Does this idea change the status quo?</li>
<li>Good venture capital investments are ideas that are both "good ideas" and "ideas that seem stupid."
<li>"The Team" - A16H loves software engineers. Are they focused? Can/will they take their product to the market? Do they have a secret? Are they relentless?</li>
<li>Sam asserted that businesses usually kill themselves as opposed to being killed by competitors. He believes that hard working developers with a good idea will be profitable 100% of the time. For this reason, he likes to get to know people on a very personal level as part of his evaluation of a potential investment.</li>
<li>"What Does the Market Look Like>" - How hard will the product be to sell? Will it "go viral"? Will ads work? Does it need salespeople? Who are the competitors? Will there be one big winner (will THIS be the big winner)? Over time, how will the market evolve?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reasons startups are exciting: It's never been cheaper to start a startup, in part due to technology such as Github and Stack Overflow; you can have an enormous impact working in a startup, as opposed to a well-established company such as Facebook; there are potentiall huge financial rewards.</li>
<li>How students can get jobs at startups: Be smart about where you apply, and also apply to multiple startups; Ask for advice! You will not end up paying for the coffee; Show your value - if you can show a knowledge about their particular company or industry, they will be impressed!</li>
<li>Want to start your own startup?? If so, answer these questions: Is it something people want? How many? Will the timing work?</li>
<li>If you have carefully considered those questions, the answer to the first and third is yes, and the answer to the second is a lot, then you WILL BE PROFITABLE!</li>
</ul>
