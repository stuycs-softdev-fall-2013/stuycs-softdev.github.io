## Minutia 05 Pd 7

* We are going to work on three things:

 * form data
 * persistant storage
 * sessions

### How the Internet works: connecting to web servers

* Usually when you connect to a URL/connect to a web server, you send a GET request to that server
* Then the server will run some program and send the appropriate response to your GET request
 * For example when you google "LaTeX," you're actually sending a GET request to that page
 * You'll see that "LaTeX" is in the URL: ""https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=laTEX&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8"
   * Please turn Google's Safe Search on in Stuyvesant
* This is called a <b> stateless protocol </b>
 * For instance, when you run a mad-lib program 20 times, then that means that you run 20 different mad-lib programs 20 times each
 * These programs have no knowledge of previous programs

### Submitting Data with Flask
* You can use Flask to create buttons, text inputs, and bullets in Flask
* We're learn the syntax on our own, but here's an example of a Submit button:
* These things are called <b> forms </b>
* They look ugly, but we'll learn how to use styling later on
* DOWNSIDES
  * All the stuff is in the URL. You may not want to have people see info you don't want them to see
  * There is a limit to how much information to send

### POST Requests
* POST Requests are used when you want to send an actual block of data
* They allow more information to be sent and cannot be seen by others
* Currently, we will use POST requests instead of GET requests 
* You must make your code set to allow POST requests

### Persistent Storage 
    
* Persistent Storage is for data that you want to place into long term storage
* Information can be added to files with Python
* There is a downside: things get messed up when two people edit the same file
* Instead, dictionary-like files called "shelves" should be used
