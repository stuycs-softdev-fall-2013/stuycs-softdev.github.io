## Seven Samurai and Mr. Zamansky's new haircut
* Mr. Zamansky explained why he got his haircut: he wanted to rub his head like the elder samurai in [The Seven Samurai](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047478/)
* [Link To Video](www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMWsOyOHaaA)
* We talked about some other oldies as well, including the [Magnificent Seven](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054047/), and the more recent [A Bug's Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120623/)


## Javascript
### JQuery
* javascript library that makes document manipulation much easier
* `$('li')` grabs all list items in the document
    - `$` function like querySelectorAll in native javascript
    - `$('li').addClass('red')` will add the class red to all list items
    - we can also bind events to all list items and perform most other action without looping
* JQuery can be slower than native javascript
* JQuery may not work across all browsers or systems

### underscore.js
* Like JQuery, but without some unecessary functionality like graphics, etc. that makes JQuery so cumbersome

### d3.js
* Graphical representation of data
