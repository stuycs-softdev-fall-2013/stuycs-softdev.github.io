###Lab Day!
Today was a lab day so most of the class spent the period collaborating with their partners on the new assignment we were given. Mr. Zamansky reminded the class that minutia should be taken on lab days and that students doing minutia have creative licence to do basically anything they want since the class will be mostly indpendent work as opposed to lecture/instruction. 


###Mr. Zamansky Pretending to Be in HS
We discussed how Mr. Zamanasky could optimally be introduced to in order to have a lasting impression. Instead of introducing Mr. Z as mentor or as "the most awesomest person ever", he thought it would be really funny if he introduced himself by saying "I went to HS with Bruce"" given that he's older than his students and was their teacher - not their classmate. BEWARE! He has fooled past classes before. 

###Github
Remember to clone github on your computers at home because the network doesn’t work well at hoem. 

###Haloween

What should Mr. Zamansky do for Halloween? 

Ideas in the past have included: Bender, Chef – Mr. Geller, Dr. Evil, Blues Brothers 

Look up Youtube videos to see Mr. Z's past performances.
