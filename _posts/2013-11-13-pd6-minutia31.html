<h1>Minutia 31 Period 6</h1>
<h2>Julie Zhu</h2>
<h2>Date: 11-13-13</h2>

<p>
Today, we talked more about Project 2. Mr. Z said that we would have today and tomorrow to plan out the project, then we would start learning how to use Github more effectively on Friday.
</p> 

<h3> Due Date? </h3>
<p>
Tentative due dates were discussed, starting with the Monday after Thanksgiving break, because Mr. Z actually wants to ruin our vacation (or like he said, make it better because we get to write programs). The Wednesday before Thanksgiving was also brought up.
</p>

<h3> Creating a Repository </h3>
<p>
Mr. Z then showed us how to create a new repository on Github for each group.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Go to new repository and name it <b>proj2-pd6-groupNumber(01-08)-groupName</b>.</li>
<li> Make the repository <b>public</b>. </li>
<li> Initialize repository with README. </li>
<li> Add .gitignore: Python. </li>
<li> Go to settings, then collaborators and add <b>stuycs-softdev/everyone</b> to teams (this means that everyone in both periods will have access to your repository).</li>
</ol>

<h3> Groupinating </h3>
<p>
Lastly, we groupinated for our project groups! We did this several times to satisfy everyone, like no repeat group members or anything. We then broke into our groups and brainstormed possible project ideas. Once a group comes up with an idea, they should describe it in the README and present it to the class next week. 
</p>
