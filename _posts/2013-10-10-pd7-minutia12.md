#Herman
- **Powers:** resolves broken relationships
- **Weakness:** beer
- **Origin:** Herman's radioactive girlfriend gave plain, old Hunter Herman a hickey. Fighting for downtrodden girlfriends the world over, his only weakness is a nice, cold beer... Now he is... *Herman*!

#Starting SQLite
##Schemas:
* Think about schemas as spreadsheets
  * Each table is a sheet
  * A record is represented by a column
  * A field is represented by a cell
* Designing a student database (plan):
  * Table: students
  * Records: one for each student
  * Fields: one for each property (ID number, first name, last name, etc.)

## Creating a SQLite database
Use `sqlite3 <somename.db>` to use sqlite3 to access `<somename.db>`

    > sqlite3 test.db
    # display databases:
    >>> .databases
    
    # display tables:
    >>> .tables

    # display help menu:
    >>> .help

    # create a table:
    >>> CREATE TABLE students(id INTEGER, last TEXT, first TEXT);

    # delete table:
    >>> drop table students;

    # read a list of commands from <somefile>:
    >>> .read <somefile>

    # the command to change a table is alter
    # NO EXAMPLE

    # new record:
    >>> insert into students values(1000, "Herman", "Hunter");

    # find records:
    >>> select * from students #selects every record
    
    # record queries: (essentially return a new table)
    >>> select first from students where last="Lane";
    >>> select * from teachers, classes;
    >>> select last, description, grade from students, grades, classes where first = "reed" and students.id = grades.id and grades.class = classes.class;


##SQLite datatypes:
* NULL : self explanatory
* INTEGER : a signed integer
* REAL : a floating point number
* TEXT : a string
* BLOB : generic data


#REGEX
* Everyone should learn how to use regex
* regex makes the world a better place
* regex, or regular expressions, are a way to describe a series of characters generally, i.e. <code>[a-z],[A-Z]</code>

#The Blob
<pre>
Beware of the blob, it creeps 
And leaps and glides and slides 
Across the floor 
Right through the door 
And all around the wall 
A splotch, a blotch 
Be careful of the blob 

(Repeats 3x)
