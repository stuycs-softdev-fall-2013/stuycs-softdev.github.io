#Minutia 21 Period 7 
##Hanson Lin
###10-25-13

The 25th was a half day so we only had a 20 minute period so not much was done. Once again, we spent class discussing our Storynator/Bloginator projects with our groups. Mr. Zamansky said that he might call our backend leaders up to have a short discussion, but ultimately that did not happen. He also reminded us that he would send out emails during the weekend to assess what we covered last year.

###Note
This minutia is number 21 as I believe Sabrina was meant to be 19, and Alvin was meant to be 20, so I decided to fix the numbering.
