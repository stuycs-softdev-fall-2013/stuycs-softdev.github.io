#Minutia 21 Period 6
##Derek Tang
##10-28-13

###Notice:

Because only 2/3 of both classes responded to the survey sent over the weekend, a new policy will be enforced regarding submitting responses. Those that respond will get a perfect quiz score and those that fail to do so will recieve a 0.

###Looking Ahead

In the coming week, we will go over algorithms. We will most likely not cover heaps due to the responses from the survey.

###Today:

The database people gathered on the putting green for a pow ow which began with some spiritual clapping. Z then proposed we play Duck, duck, goose but there wasn't enough room. After discussing what each group had been working on, the design leads were called in.
And in celebration of International Animation Day, [here's](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/194ejrsupsajijpg/ku-bigpic.jpg) an awesome poster for Pixar's new film *The Good Dinosaur*.
