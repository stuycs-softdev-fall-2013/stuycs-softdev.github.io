__GIT OVERFLOW REVIEW__

Today we went over some items about GIT from yesterday

* Mr. Z introduced a useful function which randomizes a list in EMCACS which I believe is Sort -R

We went over

* pull requests
* merge requests
 * __Note:__ it usually automatically closes once you merge it
 * You do not have to merge if you do not want to. You always have the option to close the merge.
* forking into another repository
 * __Note:__ You cannot fork repository to yourself
* managing more than one branch

We worked on our group projects for the rest of the period.
