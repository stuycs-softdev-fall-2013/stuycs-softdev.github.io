###Maze Solving Strategy 
at each decision point we want to keep track of:
- where we been
- which direction(s) we went
- which directions(s) we didn't go yet

    Up  
Left-|-Right  
   Down   
starting the maze at $, and following the sequence up, right, down, left at each decision point:
- decision pt 1: go up because up > right > down > left,and remember we can still go right or down
- pt 2: go up, and remember we can also go right
- pt 3: go left
- pt 4: reached a deadend, backtrack to pt 3, realize we gone through all possible directions at pt 3 then backtrack to pt 2
- pt 2: go right because we went up the before
- pt 5: deadend. Backtrack to pt 2, then to pt 1
- pt 1: go right because right is before down in the sequence
- pt 6: go up
- etc...

###generalized strategy using stack
_s-1-2-3-4_ -> _s-1-2-5_ -> _s-1-6-7-8_  
   R R            R            D  
   D              D

- each element in the stack is a decision point that we passed  
- each element also keeps track of the other directions we could travel
  (ie: the element "1" keeps track that we can also go Right and Down at that point)
- when we reach a wall, we pop the last entry and we end up backtracking to the preivous decision point

###recursion
-some simplification/assumptions: 
    * the maze is a grid
    * each square in this grid is a decision point

    solve(){
      if at exit:  
         done;
      else if not in valid space: #walls, or previously visited squares  
         return; 
      else{  
         solve(up);	#will go up at a decision square  
         solve(right);  # "   "  right at a decision square  
         solve(down);   # "   "  down  "  "    "       "  
         solve(left);   # "   "   left "  "    "       "

###new terms
- Depth First Search(DFS):
    * also known as blind search with linear backtracking
    * goes down a path as deep as possible until we start to backtrack
    * this is good for maping the area because this algorithm visits every corner  

- State Space Search problem:
    * a series of 'states' or different states that the 'graph' can exist in
    * was to go from oen state to another (through 'edges')
    * one state is selected as the beginning
    * optionally another state can be selected as the end  

- Graph:
    * node(s) with edge(s) that connect some of the nodes
    * directed graph (or digraph): a graph with some edges that only allow the movement in one direction
     
### misc.
- ctrl + q -> <key combination> gives you the key combination, like ctrl-c, as a single value "^C"
- labyrinth vs maze  
    * mazes - meant for people to get lost in
    * labyrinth - elaborate "zen gardens" that sometimes contains man killing minotaurs
- Mr. Zamansky said if he were to build a corn maze, he would hire a family to dress up in raggy clothes and go around crying "let us out!"
- typical routine of people trying to get out of a maze:
    - starts out careful and systematic
    - gets lazy and become sloppy -> lots of walking in circles
    - gets fed up, hungry, and annoyed -> goes back to being systematic and quickly escapes the maze
