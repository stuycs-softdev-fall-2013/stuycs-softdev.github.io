<h3> Actual Databases </h3>
<p> After a brief summary of yesterday's class, we learned about actual real life databases.
<ul>
	<li>Flat File: These are essentially large arrays that are similar to filing cabinets. They are good for small sets of data (ex: login information). </li>
	<li>Relational: Consists of separate tables that are connected by certain entries (ID#, name, course, etc.). Usually larger than flat file databases, but are easier to get answers to quereies from. They sacrifice space for speed. </li>
	<li>SQL: Stands for Structured Query Language. These are usually created by companies and sold to businesses, banks, etc. Examples of these companies include:
		<ul>
			<li>Oracle</li>
			<li>Sybase</li>
			<li>IBM</li>
			
		</ul>
		The downside is that it is expensive to buy and maintain these databases. </li>
	<li>MySQL and PostgreSQL: Slightly different "freeware" versions of SQL. They are not as good because they don't handle transactions well. </li>
	<li>SQLite: Allows 80% of the functionality of SQL, but instead with a library instead of a database. Favorable over SQL because of the expensive fees that come with SQL (maintenance, etc.). </li>
</ul>

<p> Ended class by beginning to work on a database that consisted of student superheroes and their CS grades. </p>
