Friday was spent doing work on Bloginator/Storyinator. Mr Z had some notes on
the board:

###Notes on Project:

The project must be uploaded to GitHub by 7:00 AM Monday. We will hopefully be
demoing the projects that day after finishing up state space searches. 
__IMPORTANT__: For people using MongoDB, implement it using a local DB rather
than the stuycs DB--we will be using Stuy's internet for demos, i.e. we will not
be using the internet for demos. 

Mr. Zamansky showed us his NSA-inspired GitHub monitoring practices, by which he
can see everyone's commits and contributions to the project. Word of advice to 
those not in class: commit often to make it look like you're working.
