## Minutia 08 Pd 7
### Nancy Dai
### 10/04/13

 Becuase there was a fire drill during sixth period, Mr. Z started a conversation about fire drills and various tangents, and so he decided to have that convo in 7th period as well.

* Mr. Z feels that fire drills aren't really necessary and if people don't freak out it's mostly common sense.
* Note: If there is ever a real fire, hope that you have Mr. Z then so he can feed you pizza 

 We started talking about high rise buildings and how there were some buildings that had stair cases that went straight down into the basement and during fires, people would just keep walking down them and get trapped in the basement.

 Functionality Vs. Asthetics
* People often build things for the asthethics rather than functionality.
* Donald Norman's book below has things that are focus more on asthetics and in return their functionality is pretty much nothing.

### Donald Norman - The Design of Everyday Things
 ACM - Toilet Paper algorithm

### There's a project for the weekend, which is basically to make a login framework.
* Details are online under assignments.
* Partner's were chosen by Mr. Z.

 Extra Note: Last question on the APCS test for Mr. Z's class was to draw a troll using his Andriod to connect to his bank site.

Apparently, APCS kids don't understand this question.
