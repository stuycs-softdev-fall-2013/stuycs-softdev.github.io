##Stanley Zheng
###11-08-13

###XML
	Original form of HTML
	extensible mark up language
	you can make whatever tags you want(ex. person, company, profession, etc.)
	not fun--> have to write a parser

###JSON
*Everyone loved JSON, because of its simplicity(preffered language on the net)
*www.json.org

###API stuff
*We looked at duckduckgo and tumblr's API
*if you want to use a company's API, you will usually need to register an application for an OAuth key to use their API
*OAuth is similar to crowdgrader's authentication(need to sign in with gmail)
*programmableweb.com is a resourceful website with APIs

###Moodle
*Mr. Zamansky asked us to check out the stuycs moodle server. Login details and instructions will be sent via email.

Lastly we demoed Jing's, Aaron's, David's, and Jasper's project.
