## Doing authentication on the web.

SSL is the normal encryption method on the web. You have to set it up on the server level.

DigitalOcean has a tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-create-a-ssl-certificate-on-apache-for-centos-6)

Self-signed certificates cause web browsers to alert you about it, but the connection will still be encrypted.
  In order for the certificate to be signed by an approved authority, you need to pay $$$.
  You could go to [StartSSL](http://startssl.com) to get a nice free one for a year.

*NEVER STORE UNENCRYPTED PASSWORDS*

## Using Oauth

Basically, use existing accounts to let other services authenticate the user with an existing account.
