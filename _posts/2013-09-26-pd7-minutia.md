###Python Dicts
Dictionaries are like Java Hashmaps.  Their keys must be immutable and hashable.  Their items can be any Python object.

Dictionary Constructors

	d0=dict()
	d1={}
	d2={'apple':'hello','pear':8, 42:'answer'}
	
Dictionary Operations:

* Retrieval
	
		print d2['apple'] #returns 'hello'
		print d2[42] #returns 'answer'
		
* Assignment
	
		d0['pineapple']='acorn'
		d2['pear']='fruit'
		
###Python Tuples
Tuples are immutable lists. However, their elements can be mutable.
They can also be used as dictionary keys, unlike regular lists.

Tuple Constructors

	t0=tuple()
	t1=()
	t2=("Hello",[])
	t3=(1,5,"Bar",("Hello", "World"))
	
###Flask and String Substitution
Flask uses Jinja, a powerful template engine.
	
* variables
	
		Hello {{ name }}
		Hello {{ student.name }}

* conditionals
	
		{% for student in students %}
			Hello {{ student.name }}
		{%  endfor %}
