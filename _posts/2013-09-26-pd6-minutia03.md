## Minutia 03
### Victoria Greene
### 9/26/13

###Tuple
    * Cannot be changed once it is created (like a string in java)
    * Ex: a = (1,2,3) --> a[2] = 3, a[0] = 1

###Ways to Reference Items in Dictionaries
    * Let's say you this dictionary: d={'name':'Bob','age':'21','job':'waiter'}
    * You can reference items in one of two ways:
      	  1. <h1>Hello, {{d['name']}}</h1>
	  2. <h1>Hello,	{{d.name}}</h1> 
    
###Substitutions using Dictionaries
    * You could substitute the old fashioned way like this:
      	  * s = "%s is %s years old and works as a %s."
	  * print s%("Bob","21","waiter")
    * OR you could use a dictionary:
      	  * s2 = "%(name)s is %(age)s years old and works as a %(job)s."
	  * d = {'name':'Bob',d={'name':'Bob','age':'21','job':'waiter'}
	  * print s%(d)

###We now have TWO group projects (most likely due on Monday)
    1. Madlibs
    2. Groupinator

###Note: you might want to look into RUBBER DUCK DEBUGGING, a helpful practice according to Mr. Zamansky.
