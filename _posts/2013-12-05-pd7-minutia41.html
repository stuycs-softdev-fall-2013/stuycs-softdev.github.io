<h3>Group 3: School Search</h3>

<br>

The first group to present their project made a tool for finding information about elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as colleges. There are three options. First of all, you can search by zip code or city, and you will receive a list of schools with info about their locations, number of students enrolled, etc. The second option is searching for individual universities by name, which allows you to access a list of all the departments in the university, all the teachers in each department, all the classes they teach, and info about the grades in those classes. The third option allows you to find a static map of a school's location.

The data about the schools was obtained from education.com and myedu.com through their APIs, and the maps were obtained from Google Maps through its API.

<h3>Group 8: Movie Review Generator</h3>

<br>

The second project allows you to search for a movie and then generates a review about that movie. To do this, it first takes all of the reviews from Rotten Tomatoes about that movie, as well as some reviews about "related" movies (some of these reviews needed to be screenscraped from other sites). The reviews are then processed using Markov chains: a new review is generated where for every pair of words in the new review, a list is made of all the words that follow occurences of that pair in the original reviews, and the next word is chosen from that list (the probability being determined by the number of times it occurs). This creates a very....interesting review of the movie.
