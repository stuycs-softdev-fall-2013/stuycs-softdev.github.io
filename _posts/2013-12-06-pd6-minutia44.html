<h2> More Presentations! </h2>
<p> Today we saw two more presentations. We'll be seeing the other four groups' presentations next week, 
alternating with lessons in JavaScript. </p>

<h3> Good Morning </h3>

<a href="http://softdev-server.stuycs.org:6006/"> Good Morning! Website </a> 
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/proj2-pd6-06-GoodMorning"> Good Morning! Source Code </a> 

<p> This project was created by Dorit Rein, Victoria Greene, Jason Luo and Raymond Lam, and aimed to make it easy to view
the most important information in the morning. It takes into consideration MTA Information (screenscraped from a 
constantly-updated .txt file), the weather (from a Weather Underground API), and one's events on a calendar that Victoria
created herself (and calls her baby). The group used a Pure CSS library in order to create their website. </p>

<p> The calendar was a particularly noteworthy part of this project, as Mr. Z even said that making a calendar from 
scratch is a pain. However, he pointed a section in the 
<a href=https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/proj2-pd6-06-GoodMorning/blob/master/templates/calpage.html"> calpage.html </a>
in which there are a bunch of if-else statements and advised us against this kind of coding, and to use a table instead. 
Nevertheless, it was a great project that can go in many directions. </p> 

<h3> Artificial Intelligence Dating Site / Fake Profile Generator </h3> 

<a href="http://softdev-server.stuycs.org:6005/"> Profile Generator Website </a> 
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/proj2-pd6-05-FunThingsAreFun"> Profile Generator Source Code </a> 

<p> This project was created by Jasper Lu, Arfan Rehab, Jason Zhen, Stanley Zheng, and generated fake profiles 
upon request. Originally it was going to be an AI Dating site, but due to time constraints, they only got around to 
generally a variety of fake profiles who became friends based on their assigned hobbies and interests. In order to do this,
the group used an About.me API and screenscraped from a Twitter profile generator. </p>

<p> The styling was really cool here with a responsive front page and a cool loading symbol, which the group
explained using their source code. A particularly hilarious part of the project's demostration was the fact that 
many of the fake profiles had generated the same profile picture. </p>
