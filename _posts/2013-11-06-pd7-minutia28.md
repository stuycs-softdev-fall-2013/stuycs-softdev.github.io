###CrowdGrader

Mr. Zamansky told us to go on CrowdGrader and review each others projects, and that we have until Monday to review 4 of them.

###State Space Search

We began class by reviewing Depth-first and Breadth-first search.  
Depth-first search uses a stack as its frontier, and while it does find the 
shortest path, it has to essentially map the whole maze.  
Breadth-first search uses a queue as its frontier, and while it is much quicker,
the path found is much less direct.
We also learned about iterative deepening, when a programmer uses ifs and elifs 
to only calculate to a specific number of moves, rather than the whole problem. 
This is used in chess computers.
We found the best of both worlds in a search with priority queue as its 
frontier, which uses a heuristic (a rule to find the approximate best solution).
With a heap as the priority queue, the search goes more quickly, with both 
insert and remove having O(log(n)) runtime.  However, it can run into problems 
with local maxes and minimums, and a technique called "simulated annealing" can 
help avoid this problem.
