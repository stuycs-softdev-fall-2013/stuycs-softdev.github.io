####Superhero Conversation
* Mr. Z was slightly disappointed within the lack of radioactive catwo information within the minutia for our period.
	* Catwoman is a superhero bitten by a radioactive catwo.
* We also discussed what kind of superhero a Herman would be. We safely concluded that a Herman would fix people's marriages, beat up cheating spouses, and have beer as his/her ultimate weakness.
* Next time, culture discussions should also be included within the minutia because Software Development is a class for all aspects of our character--mind, body, and soul.


    $ sqlite3 test.db
    .help (get help)
    .tables (lists any tables that exist)
    .read create_tables.sql (.sql is actually meaningless in this context because any text file can be read)
    alter ...; (change schemas)
    drop table <table_name>; (get rid of specified table after creating it)


    .read students.raw
    insert into students values(2000,'Parker','Peter'); (probably inserts those values into the table)
    select * from students; (pull out all data from table)
    select first from students; (gets first name from students)
    select first,last from students where last="Murdoch"; (gets first, last name from students with Murdoch as last name)
    select first,last from students where id > 3000 and id < 5000;
    .read grades
    .dump grades
    update students set first = "Luis" where last = "Lane"; (change first name of students with last name "Lane" to "Luis")


####Using sqlite3
* Make sure you remember the 3 in sqlite3
* Dot commands are sqlite3 commands, not SQL commands
* Non-dot commands are SQL commands
* Database schema is a way to logically group objects such as tables, views, stored procedures etc. It's like a container of objects.
* Storage classes: null, integer, real, text, [blob] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdUsyXQ8Wrs)
	
* The POWER OF SQL: idea of linking two tables together; links known as relations
	* Combining components together to make a new table


    select * from teachers,classes (cross product of teachers and classes tables)
    select teachesr.last, students.first, students.last from teachers, students where teachers.last="zamansky" and students.id = 4000;
    select last, class, grade from students, grades where last = "Reed" and students.id = grades.id;
    select last, description, grade from students, grades, classes where first = "reed" and students.id = grades.id and grades.class == classes.class;
	

####Text Manipulation
* Using emacs (but these commands are found in any worthwhile text editor)
	* Regexp: replace regular expression, find and replace operation
		* Type $ to indicate end of line
	* Insert Rectangle: insert string at particular location on every line
