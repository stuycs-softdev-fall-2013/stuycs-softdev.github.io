####Superhero Conversation
* Mr. Z was slightly disappointed within the lack of radioactive catwo information within the minutia for our period.
	* Catwoman is a superhero bitten by a radioactive catwo.
* We also discussed what kind of superhero a Herman would be. We safely concluded that a Herman would fix people's marriages, beat up cheating spouses, and have beer as his/her ultimate weakness.
* Next time, culture discussions should also be included within the minutia because Software Development is a class for all aspects of our character--mind, body, and soul.


####Using sqlite3
* Make sure you remember the 3 in sqlite3
* Dot commands are sqlite3 commands, not SQL commands
* Non-dot commands are SQL commands
* Database schema is a way to logically group objects such as tables, views, stored procedures etc. It's like a container of objects.
* Storage classes: null, integer, real, text, [blob] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdUsyXQ8Wrs)
	
* The POWER OF SQL: idea of linking two tables together; links known as relations
	* Combining components together to make a new table

####Text Manipulation
* Using emacs (but these commands are found in any worthwhile text editor)
	* Regexp: replace regular expression, find and replace operation
		* Type $ to indicate end of line
	* Insert Rectangle: insert string at particular location on every line
