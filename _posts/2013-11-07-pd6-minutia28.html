Class began with team <strong>JEJA</strong> demoing their Bloginator project.  

<br /><h3>Getting data from the internet</h3>
One method of getting data from a website is by <em>screen scraping</em>.  This involves going to the actual website and retrieving all of the HTML from the site.  

<div class="alert alert-info">Python Example:</div>
<pre><code>import urllib2

url = "http://www.nytimes.com"
request = urllib2.openurl(url)
result = request.read()
print(result)</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Drawbacks</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript changes to elements will not appear in the HTML</li>
    <li>To retrieve data you need to go through the whole mess of HTML tags just to find what you need</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>BeautifulSoup</h3>
BeautifulSoup provides the tools to more easily retrieve data from a site.
<div class="alert alert-info">Python Example:</div>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib2
url = "http://www.nytimes.com"
soup = BeautifulSoup(url)

print(soup.prettify()) # Formats the HTML in a nicer manner
print(soup.title) # Returns only the title element from the page
for a in soup.find_all('a'): # loops through all the &lt;a&gt; tags in the HTML
  print(a.get_text()) # returns only the text of the elements
</code></pre>

<h3>There has to be something easier though, right?</h3>
<h4>API</h4>
Most websites that contain data provide APIs that only output data rather than a whole entire webpage which helps web developers retrieve that data much easier.
<br /><strong>RESTful</strong> APIs allow developers to enter arguments into a <strong>GET</strong> request and have an output, normally <strong>JSON</strong>.  JSON can easily be converted directly into a dictionary which allows for much easier use than screen scraping.
