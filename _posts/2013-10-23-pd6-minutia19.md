###Today

Today was a groupwork day, so if you were absent you did not miss a lot. We spent most of the class time discussing the 
storyinator or bloginator project with our groups. We also started writing the readme file for our projects, which 
states the roles for each person in the group and a description of the project. Mr. Z then went around the class to 
check up on each group. Also, note that the project title on the website is not meant to be titled groupinator/bloginator, 
but storyinator/bloginator.
