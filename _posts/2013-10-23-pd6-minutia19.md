###Today

Today was a groupwork day, so if you were absent you did not miss a lot. We spent most the class time discussing with 
our groups the storyinator or bloginator project. We started writing the readme files for our projects stating the roles
for each person in the group and a description of the project. Mr. Z also went around the class to check up on each group.
Also, note that instructions on the website for the project is not meant to be titled groupinator/bloginator, 
but storyinator/bloginator.
