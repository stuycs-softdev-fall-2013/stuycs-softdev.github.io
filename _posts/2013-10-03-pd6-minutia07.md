	Disadvantage: Isn't built for multi-person use. 

	Solution: Flask has an add-on that makes sure the shelves don't run into problems when multiple people use them at once.

	Client --> Server: First-time use	
	Server --> Client: Login page	
	Client --> Server: Information	
	Server --> Client: Unique ID
	Client --> Server: Information to be stored in database
