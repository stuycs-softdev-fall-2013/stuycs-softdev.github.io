Making the web beautiful
------------------------

- Originally, the web wasn't about pretty
- In the olden day, monitors only displayed black and white
- HTML doesn't define *how* to render text, just the text and some hints as to the importance, etc.
- People would start to do things like put a color attribute in their tags
- To fix this, *CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets) was created

CSS
---

- CSS defines what HTML elements should look like
- Separate from the HTML, similar to the way we use Jinja templates in Flask
- You can define them inside a *style* tag
- Some CSS to make the text in h1 elements yellow would be:
`
h1 {
 color: yellow;
}
`
- You can also do specific things when conditions are satisfied, such as a mouse-over:
`
h1:hover {
color:blue;
}
`
- You can take advantage of classes:
`.odd { background-color: pink; }`
- You'll find a lot of div tags, which is basically just a container
- There are a *ton* of things you can do with CSS, you might want [a CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) [reference](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp) of some kind
- There are even CSS libraries to help you make stuff

Emacs has a built-in webserver, because that _totally_ belongs in an editor
Seriously, who saw their text editor and thought "That could really use a webserver in it"?
