## Group with too much hair
* Mr. Zamansky commented that Zane, Josh, Hunter, and Glib's group had too much hair.
    - Everyone seemed to agree

## Lab Day
* The rest of the period was taken up by groupwork.  We did the following...
    - Worked out the details of the project idea
    - Pitched those ideas to Mr. Zamansky
    - Worked on the README.md file for each of our repositories
    - Decided the tasks and timeline for the project, and delegated those tasks


## Other info
* Mr. Zamanksy said that the task delegation in this type of project might be different because the nature of the project itself might be completely different
