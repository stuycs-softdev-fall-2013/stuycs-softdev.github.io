# The Catwo

* We don't know what a catwo looks like
* It does not necessarily look like or relate to a cat
* Therefore, Thluffy could be a catwo

# Using SQLite3 with Python

* SQLite expressions can be used in Python files
* Note: We should always be using SQLite3 for classwork.  Some methods are not consistent between versions, which may cause code to break.

```
# importing sqlite3
> import sqlite3

# connecting to db server
> connection = sqlite3.connect("test.db")

# create and save a statement
> q = "SELECT * FROM teachers")

# executing the statement
> cursor = connection.execute(q)

# printing the cursor
> for line in cursor:
>    print line
# Note: The cursor does not go back.  You can't loop twice.
```

Any SQL command can be used from Python


# Project: Updating Login

* We have to update our app.py from the login project
* It should use an SQL database instead of a shelf
* Create an auth.py with the following methods:
  * adduser: adds user to database
  * authenticate:  checks if good or bad login
* We work with the same partners from the login project
