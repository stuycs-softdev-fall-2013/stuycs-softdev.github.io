title: hw 3 - flask madlibs
---

For assignment 3 you are going to make a simple web site that generates mad libs.

 * Make a flask application in your github submissions directory. Make the python program app.py and remember the templates directory.
 * Make a template for a madlib (a page with substitutions for parts of speech)
 * Your app.py should have lists for parts of speach and should randomly select one for each substitution point on the page.

For example, if the page contained:

One day PROPERNOUN was VERB through the PLACE. there he found a ADJECTIVE NOUN

etc.

You will have lists for PROPERNOUN, VERB, PLACE etc and you will fill the template with a random selection from each of these lists (as described in class).

Please feel free to go nuts and have fun with this - this describes just the basic functionality.

Please place a copy of this in your submissions folder under directory named 3-madlibs. Please have a copy in both your and your partner's repositories and make sure you have a comment in app.py noting the team members.
