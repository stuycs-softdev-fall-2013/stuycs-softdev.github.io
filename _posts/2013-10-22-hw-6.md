Thi project is due on Monday November 4 at 7:00am. The project
should't take that long but this way you can have some flexibility in
your schedule.

I've made two repositories under github:

 * [http://github.com/stuycs-softdev/proj1-6](http://github.com/stuycs-softdev/proj1-6)
 * [http://github.com/stuycs-softdev/proj1-7](http://github.com/stuycs-softdev/proj1-7)

Each group should:

 1. Make a folder in the appropriate repository (one per group)
 2. Create a README.md (markdown formatted) proposing the project. It should:
  1. State who is the group leader.
  2. State who is taking on what role for the project.
  3. Descibe the project (including how you will store the data and the use flow).
  4. Describe a timetable

The project should:
 1. Use css for styling. Either using a framework like bootstrap, zurb, or purecss.io  or something home rolled.
 2. Use either MongoDB or SQLite3 to store the data.
 3. I should see multiple commits from ALL team members over the course of the project.

You will have some time in class but most of the project will be done at home.

**Note:** We should really have one repository per group rather than one per class so we're not really using GitHub "correctly." We'll fix that on the next project.
