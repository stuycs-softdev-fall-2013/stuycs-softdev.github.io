###Survey

Only 50/64 students filled out the survey that Mr. Z sent us over the weekend. Because of that, we have a new policy for questions that require responses:

-If you don't respond, you get a 0 for a quiz grade.

-If you do, you get a 100 for a quiz grade, which doesn't mean anything because it shouldn't change your grade if you've been doing what you're supposed to in class.
 
__Example of question that requires response:__

Question: Should Zane cut his hair

Response: Clearly not.

The survey response indicated that 50% of us were comfortable with Maze Solver. This was not the class when we took a poll in class. We'll be over over some algos this week.

###Project

Mr. Z had a meeting with one backend member of each group. Afterwards, he had a meeting with the frontend members. We will have 1/2 lab days to work on the project this week.
