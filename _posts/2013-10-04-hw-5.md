title: hw 5 - Login framework - Due Monday 10/7
---

For this weekend, you and your partner will be writing a framework to
maintain accounts.

You will have to:

 1. Make a register page  - this will accept a username and password and store them in a shelve (using the flask-shelve module and use the username as the key).
 2. Make a login page that has a login button and a link to the register page. When you log in, save the username in the session and then redirecto to some other page.
 3. Make a logout route that pops the username from the session.
 4. For other pages (and make one or two of them), if the user isn't logged in (no username in session) - redirect them to the login page. If they are logged in, display the page.

Put this under submissions/login/6 or submissions/login/7 make a folder under the appropriate location named for both you and your partner.
