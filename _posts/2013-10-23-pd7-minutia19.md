#Minutia 19 Period 7
##Alvin Leung
###10-23-13

Today we spent class discussing our Storyinator/Groupinator projects with our groups. While we worked, Z went around to each group to check up on us. He also said that he would periodically email us to remind us of some small things that could do.

###Note
The group assignment is Storyinator or Bloginator NOT Groupinator like it says on the assignments page
