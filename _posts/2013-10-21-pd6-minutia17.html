<h2>Agenda: Dealing with Stuyling(Styling)</h2>

<p>Some prehistoric facts about <strong>HTML</strong> during the Medieval Times (1990s)</p>

<ol>
<li>When <strong>HTML</strong> was first used, the terminal was displayed in black and white, not gray scale. </li>
<li>Typically, the terminal did not support some features such as <strong>bold</strong>. This meant that the output of <strong>bold</strong> had to be viewed in the browser.</li>
</ol>

<p>It was also mentioned that when websites, these days, have a similar layout to magazines. When using historic <strong>HTML</strong> to code headers, for example, one would have to change each header individually. Due to this lack of efficiency, CSS(Cascade Style Sheets) Styling has been introduced.</p>

<h2>CSS Styling</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mr.Zamansky introduced one way of using style sheets by defining them within the <em>style</em> tags.</li>
<li>CSS Styling is separate from the <strong>HTML</strong></li>
<li>You can manipulate style using classes by doing .nameofclass{feature}, for example: you would use .odd{background-color:gray;} to set whatever that has class odd to a gray background <strong>NOTE:</strong> the color can be defined using hexadecimal (color:#FF0000)</li>
<li>You can also use divide(div) tags which separates code to their own specific area</li>
<li>It is <strong><em>RECOMMENDED</em></strong> to search up the <a href="http://cssmenumaker.com">CSS menu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is a website that gives css code to easily create user interfaces. Bootstrap essential gives you full functionality of different types of grids, tables, buttons, and images without you doing the hard work!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Something new about Mr. Zamansky</h2>

<p>He is not a visual programmer.</p>
