<h1>Minutia 18 Period 7</h1>

<h2>CSS Stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong> is probably the most famous CSS framework. It was used to make twitter, then released to the public as an open source project.</li>
<li>Other famous CSS frameworks/libraries include ZURB FOUNDATION (which has a yeti for a mascot), purecss.io, 960 grid, minimalist grid, and others. </li>
<li><strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Zurb</strong> are large, very inclusive libraries. The downside to this is that your web application will look a lot like everyone else's web applications.</li>
<li>CSS files often come in 2 versions: a regular version, which is readable to a normal human, and a min version, which is very compact in order to speed up the transfer of information.</li>
<li>Bootstrap is well documented; visiting the website http://getbootstrap.com/ can teach you how to use this awesome framework.</li>
</ul>


<h2>General Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Zamansky spent some of class using his magic fingers to make awesome code rapidly appear on the screen. It was surreal.</li>
<li>A window blind was open today. As a result, the room filled with an ethereal light. Student awakeness increased drastically. Still, Zane managed to sleep through Mr. Zamansky changing the emacs font.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our first 4 person project is upon us. It will be due Monday, November 3rd.</li>
<li>For the project, each group has 2 choices: storyinator or bloginator. Storyinator involves editing, adding, removing, and changing a story. Bloginator involves making a system for blog posts and comments.</li>
<li>Each group must have a team leader, a back-end leader, and a front end leader. The final person, clearly a loser, can work on the middleware.</li>
<li>Each group should come up with a proposal, including designation of roles, describing the database that they will use for their back end, and describing how they plan to implement their project. This proposal should be e-mailed to the class mailing list.</li>
</ul>
