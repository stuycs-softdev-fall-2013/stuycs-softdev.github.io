### Connecting To Web Servers
    
    * When you connect to a web server, the connection you created goes away right after you get the data you requested
    * Usually when you get data from a website, you use a "GET request"
    * GET requsts can only contain a small amount of information
    * When using a search engine, the search that you make is tacked onto the end of the url
    * For example if you search for "aardvarks in nyc" in google, you'll actually be sending a GET request for the page
    * "https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=aardvarks+in+nyc&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8"

### More Flask Stuff (Submitting Data)
    
    * You can easily create buttons and boxes to input text useing Flask
    * We're expected to learn the exact syntax on our own
    * Eventually we'll learn to use styling to make our buttons less ugly
    
### POST Requests 
    
    * POST requests allow you to send much more data than GET requests
    * Data you send in POST requests isn't meant to be seen by others
    * For now we'll be useing POST requests instead of GET requests
    * In order to do this you must make your python code to be set to allow POST requests 

### Persistent Storage 
    
    * Persistent Storage is information that's meant to be stored longterm
    * You can use Python to create or add information to text files
    * However, we'll probably never use that - things get screwed up when 2 people change the file at the same time
    * Instead, dictionary-like files called "shelves" should be used
