Cookies
=======

-Cookies are a way to store persistent data in the browser to remember user-specific information. Flask uses a protocol called wsgi, which makes cookies pretty easy to use.

To get cookies:

`@app.route('/')`
`def index():`
     `username = request.cookies.get('username')`

-And to store them:

`@app.route('/')`
`def index():`
    `resp = make_response(render_template(...))`
    `resp.set_cookie('username', 'the username')`
    `return resp`

Sessions
========
-Sessions are another way to store user-specific data.

-Uses a secret code in a cookie's data to identify it

-We'll learn more about how to use them, but the basic idea is that they allow the server to remember clients' cookies, and keep track of user data as such.

Mini-Project
============
We're going to have a mini project to make a login system over the weekend. We'll be learning more tomorrow about how to do this.
