###State Space Problems:

#####  1. Knight's Tour
* Problem: you start on one square of a chess board and try to visit every square once.
* One variation of this problem is that you start and end on the same square.
* "Paradox": it works for all 5x5 boards, doesn't work for 3x3 boards, works on 1x1 boards.
 
#####  2. N Queens
* Place N queen chess pieces on a NxN chessboard such that all queens are in a safe configuration. 

#####  3. Rubix Cube

#####  4. 15th Puzzle
* It's a game that we've all played before: where you have 15 pieces in a square and you're trying to order them.
