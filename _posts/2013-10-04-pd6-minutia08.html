<h3> Fire Drills </h3>
<p> We started class today waiting for the fire drill to begin. After returning from the 14-minute procession, Mr. Zamansky mentioned the lack of use for fire drills, considering how we often react differently to fire-related situations. He mentioned the arsenist, the bomb threat at the World Trade Center, the smoke wafting from the neighboring building, and the 9/11 attacks. </p>

<h3> Design </h3>
<p> On the note of fires, we started discussing basements. Using Stuy as an example, Mr. Zamansky noted that basements have their own, separate set of stairs, as is customary with most modern buildings. This is because in the past, when a fire occurred, people would run straight down into the basement instead of exiting on the first floor, essentially leaving them stranded.</p>

<p> Jumping off this point, Mr. Zamansky mentioned Donald Norman's <b>The Design of Everyday Things</b>. In this best-selling book, Norman discusses the design of simple objects, and why some objects please their users while others frustrate them. Norman also popularized the term user-centered design, which Mr. Zamansky mentioned is very applicable to computer science. We used the example of toilet paper dispensers in class.</p>

<h3> Homework </h3>
<p> At the very end, we quickly counted off to 16 in two sets to pair off for our weekend assignment. The two absentees will be paired off with one another. </p>
