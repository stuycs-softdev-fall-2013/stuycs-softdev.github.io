#Minutia 20 Period 6
## By: Dorit Rein
##### October 24, 2013

Today we continued to have groupwork. Most of the class was spent discussing and planning out our projects with our groups.

Mr. Z found out that we did not cover breadth first search in our APCS classes last year. Thus, Mr. Z plans to have us fill out a form next week to check what we have and havent done. Check your e-mails next week for more details.

Tomorrow, Mr. Z will likely have a pow-wow with the database people in our groups. Don't forget that we have 20 minute periods tomorrow!

To end this fairly boring minutia, I will leave you all with my favorite pick me up: Good Bad Jokes!!!

   Here are some of my favorites:
* Why was six afraid of seven? Because seven is a registered six offender.
* What's the difference between a piano and a fish? You can tune a piano but you canâ€™t tuna fish!
* How much does a hipster weigh? An instagram!
