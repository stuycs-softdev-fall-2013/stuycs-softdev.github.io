<h3> Project Presentations </h3>
Today, we met with our groups to plan our project presentations. The presentation should be around 7 minutes long and should hit these major points: what the project does, a demo, which APIs were used, key elements of code. **TIP**: If necessary, make an account beforehand to save presentation time, unless the login is especially nice and should be shown!

<h3> Javascript Homework</h3>
Our homework is to write a program using Javascript that allows the user to click a button to make a color cycle down a list. It should wrap to top after reaching the bottom. There should also be a button for the opposite direction! All the code written in class is on Github already.

<h3> Regarding Grades</h3>
Mr. Z said that since grades are due on Friday, he will grade the projects now but reserves the right to change the grade next week, especially individual grades based on contribution to the project.
