<h4>We continued our discussion on the Javascript assignment, which will be due on Friday.The assignment is to create a page with a list and a button. The first item in that list should be different in some way (different color) and everytime you click on the button that difference should cylcle down to the next item on that list. </h4>


<h3>Projects and Presentations</h3>

<br>

<h4>We begin presenting tomorrow! The groups will present in reverse order and each presentation should be seven minutes long. If you go overtime because you are answering interesting questions, it is fine, but come in knowing what you want to talk about. If you need more than 7 minutes, you shoudl have already spoken to Mr.Zamansky.</h4>
