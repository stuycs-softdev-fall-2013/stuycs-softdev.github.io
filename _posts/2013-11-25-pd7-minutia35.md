## Minutia 35
### Maia Ezratty

### JAVASCRIPT
* Don't use codeacademy to teach you javascript
* javascript is called javascript because they thought java was cool at the time (for some reason)
* At its core, javascript is a lisp-- a functional programming language like scheme
* If you have a browser, you have javascript (browsers are not ideal for debugging, though)
* Beyond the core, there is little consistency among browsers --> you have to do a lot of testing in different environments
* Javascript will be our primary environment for the rest of the term and most of next term

### The Console
* right click --> inspect element --> console
* The console is a repl (read, evaluate, print, loop)
* console.log is useful for debugging
* You can get and change elements from your file in the console by using document.getElementByTagName or document.getElementByClassName, etc.
* When typing in the console, shift+enter to go to a new line
* 1 line: uou don't need brackets, multiple lines: you do

### Data Structures in Javascript
L = [1,2,3,4,5]
L[2] returns 3
L['hello'] = 33
L.hello returns 33
a = {'one':1, 'two':2}
a['one'] and a.one both return 1
so they're not just lists or dictionaries, they're objects!
  
###Remember
* Scripts should go at the bottom of the web page (<script> </script> stuff)
* Always declare variable with "var" (i.e., var c = 1.2 instead of c = 1.2)
